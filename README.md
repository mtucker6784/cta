# Legion LFR Call to arms finder.
LFR Call to arms

I created this addon as a way to monitor Legion's "Call to Arms" for the raid finder wings without having to manually check the RF menus.

It's a very basic addon with the following options:

/cta d = Find RF DPS CTA

/cta h = Find RF Healer CTA

/cta t == Find RF Tank CTA

/cta nums == IDs of each LFR wing that Blizzard labeled. Doesn't do much for regular players.


Enhancements/requests/bug fixes should be posted on this github repo; but please note that LUA is not my strong spot. I don't plan on getting very technical with this addon as it currently serves its purpose. I wanted to offer this as an opportunity for others to use who are interested in something basic to monitor RF CTAs. However, if others want to contribute / fix / add, feel free to do a PR against the development branch.

 

If you decide to modify this addon and paste it backup on curse, I just ask that my credits remain intact.
